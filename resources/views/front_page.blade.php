                Hi, my name is Samantha and you’ll have to excuse me for blushing as I talk about this…
            </p>
            <p>
                See, I’m kind of a shy, reserved girl and what I’m going to be talking about here… well… let’s just say it’s definitely NOT safe for polite company.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s actually about a topic that’s REALLY important to us girls… even though we’d never admit it to your face…
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>It’s about your penis.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                More specifically… it’s about the <b><u>size of your penis</u></b> and how secretly your girl or any girl that you’re hoping to make yours right now…
            </p>
            <p>
                Really does wish you were bigger, no matter what she tells you.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know that this might sting a little to hear, and I really hope you’ll forgive me for being so blunt…
            </p>
            <p>
                But, look I’m a woman and I know how women ACTUALLY feel about this…
            </p>
            <p>
                Whenever my girlfriends and I get together… we’re always talking about our sex lives.
            </p>
            <p>
                And I can tell you with absolute certainty…
            </p>

            <p>
                And whenever a woman recalls an experience with that guy…
            </p>
            <p>
                You can hear her voice change, watch her eyes get wide as dinner plates, and see her get hot and bothered as she recalls how it made her feel.
            </p>
            <p>
                And even if she was a virgin when she met you… and you’re the only man she’s ever been with…
            </p>
            <p>
                If she’s at brunch with her girlfriends and they’re recalling the fabulous orgasms they felt when they were penetrated with a big, thick and impressive member…
            </p>
            <p>
                It won’t be long until she’ll feel like she got “cheated” out of that experience and is missing out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, I don’t want to insult you here… obviously us girls do care about more than just your size.
            </p>
            <p>
                And I’m not saying it’s impossible for a girl to enjoy sex with a guy that’s more average in size or even smaller…
            </p>
            <p>
                I mean there’s always his tongue or fingers to give us pleasure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Which does feel good…
            </p>
            <p>
                …but BELIEVE ME every straight woman lives her entire life fantasizing about being filled up and stretched to the maximum…
            </p>
            <p>
                It just makes sex so much more fulfilling and once we’ve had that experience… there’s <u>no turning back!</u>
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s just a fact that a bigger, thicker member stimulates so much more of our sensitive spots and feels so much better than an average or smaller one.
            </p>
            <p>
                So why am I telling you this?
            </p>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And how my boyfriend discovered that unless you’re at least 7.5 inches erect… you have a hidden well of potential size that has gone untapped…
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Robbing you of the impressive member you were supposed to have all along.

                    <p>
                        I know this from personal experience because my boyfriend <b><u><i>actually did it.</i></u></b>

                        I’m going to tell you how he discovered a strange “Diamond Method” that triggers a cellular response <u>inside of your member</u> forcing it to grow larger and wider.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In fact, my boyfriend was able to increase his own penis size by nearly 4 inches in length and also added a nice 2-inch in thickness as well!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And best of all… it works fast!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He was able to add length and girth I could feel… <b><u>in less than 30 days.</u></b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, I did always love my boyfriend and we had a good relationship before…
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But I will admit that his bedroom performance left me wanting more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If I’m being honest, I was always left wanting <u>a lot more</u>…
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Especially since I had already been with a guy that was able to make me gasp with explosive orgasms from his penis that was at least 3 inches longer and a couple inches thicker…

                My eyes still get as wide as dinner plates when he pulls it out and I get to see it… large and powerful in all of its glory…
            </p>
            <p>
                I love to hold it, fondle it, and try to fit it in my mouth…

            </p>
            <p>
                I have to admit, just seeing his massive penis can bring me so close the verge of orgasm… that he only needs to put in the head to make me EXPLODE!
            </p>

                And since I know how important this is to girls, and I know that guys want better sex too…

            <p>
                In just the next 3 minutes and 48 seconds… I’m going to spill the beans and tell you exactly how he was able to do it.

                        Well, wouldn’t you know just a few minutes later a bright red pick up truck pulled up behind me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And a cute guy with glasses and dark brown hair got out and walked up to the driver’s side door and introduced himself as Mike.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mike was my knight in shining armor as he swapped out my spare, then followed me to a repair shop that put on a brand new tire for me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While the shop was doing the work on my car, he offered to take me out for dinner and I accepted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He was so charming, smart, and nice… I developed a crush on him right away.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We started dating and really hit it off.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have to admit by our 3rd date I was ready for him to invite me back to his place… but he was such a gentleman he waited until date 5.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There I was in his living room, slightly buzzed from my 3rd glass of Merlot when he leaned in to kiss me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Soon we had our hands all over each other and he picked me up and carried me off to the bedroom.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He took his time, kissed me all over my body, and started touching me in a way that made me feel really good.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I felt myself getting really excited and whispered in his ear…

                        But when Mike first stripped down to his underwear and I saw what he was working with…
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I hate to admit this… it will make me sound like such a “size queen….”

                        But my heart sank!

                    <p>
                        He didn’t even look to be a full 5 inches in length and was even less impressive around.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Just my luck…” I thought to myself… “I finally met a really nice, handsome, and charming guy and he’s hung like a mouse…”

                        See there are a few common “myths” about size that you’ve probably heard that are just NOT true at all…
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For instance…
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You might have heard that since you can make a girl feel good with your finger… that you don’t need a big penis to satisfy her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’ve never understood this reasoning… I mean I like a guy that knows how to use his hands…
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But I’m going to be frank here… your penis isn’t as nimble as your fingers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To make me feel good, a guy’s member has to stretch and create tension on my clitoris and on other sensitive spots inside of me…
                    </p>
                </div>

            <p>
                Another common myth guys get told is that since the g-spot is only about 2 inches in…
            </p>
            <p>
                Anything over 2 inches is more than enough…
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t know who in the world came up with this but I GUARANTEE it wasn’t a woman…
            </p>
            <p>
                While a few of our “sensitive spots” are closer to the outside…
            </p>
            <p>
                The “Deep Spot” or “A Spot” as gynecologists call it…
            </p>
            <p>
                Which is one of the most satisfying erogenous zones… is much further up inside a woman’s vagina.
            </p>
            <p>
                And this is THE magic spot that can really make us explode with intense, vaginal orgasms.
            </p>
            <p>
                The kind that makes us worship the guy we’re with… instead of disrespecting him, being difficult, or testing him all the time…
            </p>
            <p>
                And I can tell you as a woman that it definitely feels better to have a longer, thicker member hit those spots.
            </p>
            <p>
                A bigger penis makes better contact and fills me up so that the sensation is more intense.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you just have an average or smaller penis… you’re not creating the same level of intensity.

            <p>
                It’s really just that simple.

                Us girls absolutely DESPISE dealing with men’s ego issues…
            </p>
            <p>
                If we like a guy, we’re not going to insult him or hurt his feelings by telling him that he isn’t getting the job done.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead… we’ll probably look for an excuse to dump him.

            <p>
                What’s worse is we’ll probably tell all of our girlfriends about how lame the guy’s penis was…
            </p>
            <p>
                We might even laugh about it with our much better hung new boyfriends…

                I realize this isn’t exactly “nice” but hey… men tell lots of mean jokes about fat girls behind their backs…

                I’m not proud to admit it but girls can be just as mean.

                        But I stuck with Mike because he had everything else in a guy I wanted.

                    <p>
                        It really can be challenging for a girl to find a guy that is nice, charming and successful.

                    <p>
                        However, if a girl just isn’t that into sex with a guy, well… I doubt I have to explain how it can strain a relationship.

                    <p>
                        I mean obviously I gave him “token sex” so he wouldn’t break it off… but I know he could tell I wasn’t really into it.

                        I had only been with one other guy before him so I had no idea guys could get so big.

                        I still remember it overwhelming my small hands when I grabbed it for oral sex…

                        But the absolute, most life-changing part was when he put it in me for the first time…

                        I’d heard that expression before but nothing prepared me for the actual experience of it.

                    <p>
                        It gave me a body-quaking orgasm that rocked my world…
                        Without him even thrusting me…

                        Just the sensation of him being inside of me was enough to set me off…

                        Unfortunately, he was a total jerk and cheated on me whenever he was traveling with the hockey team.

                    <p>
                        Next, he saw a lot of guys recommending something called “jelqing.”

                    <p>
                        Jelqing is an exercise method that is designed to stretch out the erectile chambers of a man’s member…
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The problem is that Jelqing exercises can actually be <u><b>very dangerous!</b></u>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not only can you cause damage to your ligaments and blood vessels, but you can also get painful bruises that make sex impossible.

                However, Mike wasn’t the kind of guy to give up easily… so he kept looking.

            <p>
                And just at the point where it seemed hopeless…
            </p>
            <p>
                He happened to run across a Reddit forum written by a guy who went by the handle <b>M9ter</b> who seemed to really know what he was talking about.
            </p>
            <p>
                When he began looking through his posts online, he discovered that <b>M9ter</b> was different from all the other so-called “experts.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike most of the posters who just wanted to hawk cheap supplements or taught generic Jelqing exercises… he had a very unique take.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not only did he have a TON of knowledge, but it seemed like he “practiced what he preached.”
            </p>
            <p>
                He had posted some pictures of his “transformation” just to prove that everything he said was legit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since this guy actually seemed to be the real deal, Mike decided to reach out to him.
            </p>
            <p>
                A couple of days later he was sifting through his inbox over lunch and saw a reply message from “M9ter” who introduced himself as CJ.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a quick e-mail exchange, Mike asked CJ if he would “coach” him on his methods…
            </p>
            <p>
                And CJ said that he got tons of requests and since he had a busy career as a Mechanical Engineer that he charged $500 for a 1-hour consultation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, that was more than Mike had hoped to invest… but the idea of finally having a “tool” that could satisfy women in bed and getting rid of the shame and embarrassment of an inadequate member…
            </p>
            <p>
                He felt that it was worth it…
            </p>
            <p>
                So he pulled out his credit card and invested the money for the private consultation… CJ gave him his personal cell number and after talking on the phone for a few minutes…

                        It turns out CJ had his own struggles in his mid-20s when he was laughed out of the bedroom after a woman got an eyeful of his puny, 5-inch member…

                    <p>

                    <p>
                        He spent literally years testing different natural enlargement methods with no results until he came across a study performed by the London Research Institute.<sup>(2)</sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This study noted that during puberty something unique happened inside the tissues of your manhood…

                        See, at the heart of the massive surge in growth during puberty is a process that scientists call <i>cytomechanical elongation</i>…
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What this means is that on a microscopic level, puberty causes your penis to bulge and expand ever so slightly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This causes your body to release a surge of growth factors that target your manhood and quickly make it grow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This process repeats until this bulging stops because your body is fully grown… so your penis also stops growing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To the untrained eye… there was nothing exceptional about this observation…
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But when CJ found it, everything changed.

                    <p>
                        Because he was a mechanical engineer, he noticed something that everyone else seemed to miss.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He discovered there’s a way you can stimulate <i>cytomechanical elongation</i> with a safe series of moves that don’t overstrain your member…
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They’re gentle enough not to cause injury yet they’re powerful enough to replicate what happens during puberty on a cellular level…

                    <p>
                        And that was the “lightbulb moment” that led him down a path to…

                By developing a series of safe, gestures that worked differently from the aggressive straining methods like Jelqing.
            </p>
            <p>
                See, Jelqing relies on stretching the tissues, which can cause blood vessels to rupture, and ligaments to strain or even tear…
            </p>
            <p>
                But CJ’s unique method relied more on pressure… causing the same stimulation that creates “cytomechanical elongation” but without the risk of damaging the sensitive tissues of your manhood.
            </p>
            <p>
                And being an expert engineer… CJ was able to calculate precisely how much “pressure” was needed to stimulate growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                So that he didn’t waste time doing things that were unnecessary and ineffective…
            </p>
            <p>
                He called his unique exercise the “Diamond Method” because just like continuous pressure can turn coal into diamonds… these gestures could turn an ordinary penis into the long, thick penis your woman truly craves.
            </p>
            <p>
                CJ taught Mike just 1 of his powerful exercises there on his phone consultation which any guy can do right in the comfort of his own home…
            </p>
            <p>
                …without any special equipment and without anyone knowing he was doing it…
            </p>
            <p>
                And I didn’t know he was doing this either because, at this time, he was called away to Germany for 4 weeks on a project for his company…
            </p>
            <p>
                I missed him while he was away…
            </p>
            <p>
                And even though up to that point our sex life was very mediocre… I guess what they say is true and absence really does make the heart grow fonder.
            </p>
            <p>
                So the night he got back…

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I reached down to massage his crotch from over his jeans when he started to really swell.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And when I unzipped his pants… I was SHOCKED at what was poking out from behind the thin cloth of his boxer briefs…
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My eyes nearly bulged out of their sockets at the sight in front of me!

                    <p>
                        A bigger and noticeably thicker member than he had before.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I thought I was imagining things… like I was so horny and missed him so much that my mind had made his penis bigger.

                    <p>
                        It overwhelmed my hands and there were still a few solid inches of shaft remaining.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But what really stood out to me was the size and power of the head of his member…
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, I’m going to turn red as a tomato as I say this but I have a confession…

                    <p>
                        I have a MAJOR fetish for the head of a man’s member…
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A big, thick one makes me so wet… I start to ooze down my thighs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There’s just something about a big head makes me feel so giddy and happy and feminine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And that night, I had to give him a blowjob.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His penis just demanded I put it into my mouth…
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And as soon as I tried to stuff his member into my mouth… I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that <b><i>he was
                                bigger.</i></b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I remember gagging a bit as I tried to move down his shaft… which was never a problem before.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was so satisfying to flutter my lips around his member, and lick his head, shaft, and balls…
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I got so turned on doing this… I ached in my vagina to feel him inside of me…

                His thicker head and shaft stretched my clitoris and sent needles of satisfying pleasure through my whole body…

            <p>
                After merely a few quick strokes he overwhelmed me with such awe-inspiring pleasure…

                We finally collapsed on the bed…

                My small head resting on his chest, feeling so safe, happy, and well-fucked that I never wanted to leave his side…

            <p>
                I have to admit I would have done almost ANYTHING he asked to please him in that moment…

                Then… almost by accident, I asked him “honey, are you getting BIGGER?”

            <p>
                And he just laid there with self-assured confidence on his face that made me melt.

                There’s just nothing sexier than a confident guy… except of course, a confident guy with a BIG penis.

                        I was fondling his massive manhood and the warm shaft loomed over my face and blocked out the moonlight peering into the room through his window…

                        And I realized in that moment that he had the longest, thickest, and most impressive penis I had ever seen in my entire life!

                        But it wasn’t a scripted line… it just came out of me naturally because I was so overwhelmed with what I was seeing!

                    <p>
                        It was so big I couldn’t even get it halfway in before tears started forming in the corners of my eyes and my gag reflex pulsed in the back of my throat.

                    <p>
                        I pulled it out and began to lightly bat it against my face…

                        Every time his big, thick, warm head splashed against my cheeks…

                That night was easily the most pleasurable of my entire life…

                Even just talking about it makes my knees wobbly, gets my heart racing, and unleashes a tide of red flush into my face and chest.

                But after we collapsed from yet another marathon of intense orgasms…

                I told him “honey, you’ve got to stop… you’re almost TOO big for me now.”

            <p>
                So he agreed and his member has been holding at a solid nine and a quarter inches ever since.

                You just switch to maintenance mode and with merely a few minutes a week…

                But I know a lot of women out there are angry, irritable and flat-out depressed at how unsatisfying and mediocre their sex lives are.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know they browbeat and nag their husbands and boyfriends… not because they don’t care about them.. but because

                    <p>
                        To see her eyes go wide and her mouth drop open when she sees the sexual weapon you wield?
